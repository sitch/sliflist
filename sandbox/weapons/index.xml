Bungie dropped a Developer Insights video discussing how they were built; it&amp;rsquo;s actually really good - check it out!

Since D1, I&amp;rsquo;ve greatly enjoyed Fusion Rifles as they&amp;rsquo;re one of the most unique weapons Destiny has to offer. They&amp;rsquo;re also pretty darn confusing to reason about.

Effects of Range PART 1 : Range MEANS NOTHING on Hand Cannons - CoolGuy, 2019-10-28
Adding Range to a Hand Cannon has minimal gain. &amp;ldquo;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t dismantle a great Hand Cannon roll because it isn&amp;rsquo;t max range.&amp;rdquo; When you add on Range to a Hand Cannon you get minimal gains: (35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)</description></item><item><title>Shotguns</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/weapons/shotguns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/weapons/shotguns/</guid><description>Season 15 Shotgun-related changes 7/6 3.2.1 - Too complex to summarize. Search for &amp;ldquo;Weapon Archetypes&amp;rdquo;. 8/21 TWAB - While sliding, players now incur the following weapon penalties: -20 Stability, +15% shotgun pellet spread, 1.5x flinch Rifled Barrel v.

There are two of these as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
